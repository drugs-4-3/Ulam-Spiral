/**
 * Created by Micha≈Ç on 10.08.2016.
 *
 * This class is used to keep order of putting different elements of spiral in the right place.
 * We do this by returning Point2D object for every other call of move method.
 * Coordinates of this point tells us where to put next element of spiral as in XY axis in computer graphics.
 * For example: if returned point is (0,1) that means that it should be placed under the previous element.
 * Returned point always has one coordinate equal 0 and other equal +-value "stepLength" defined in the constructor.
 * Directions sequence (enum Direction) and starting directions (setDirections) are chosen subjectively.
